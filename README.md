# First-Capstone
This is my first Capstone project!

I made this page as a challenge to review my knowledge in various topics like EJS, Express.js, adding files internally and more!
It lets you create, delete or edit simple posts. When you create a post, it generates it's EJS file and stores it in the "views" folder, deleting and editing works the same. Hope you enjoy this!

To run the server, just install the node modules typing "npm i" in a new terminal on your folder, then on the same terminal type "node index.js" and that's it! Type in your favorite browser "http://localhost:3000" and enjoy!
